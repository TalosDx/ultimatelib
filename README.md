# Ultimate lib for safety do any operation

Every time I change a project I am missing some functionality in the libraries. Each time you have to either write them again or connect external dependencies, which is difficult to do on legacy projects with Java 8. Because the project can already use this library and is firmly tied to a certain version of it, or the library is forked altogether and it is impossible to update it because for the fact that it is nailed to the framework inside.
Therefore, this library was created where I or you will add everything that seems necessary.

I doubt that it will result in something big, but let it be, maybe with time I will pour features into it.
